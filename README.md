# TRUST_TRIR_analysis
Post-processing code for TRUST and T2-TRIR data.

HOW TO:

- Open TRIR_main.m or TRUST_main.m

- Without making any changes, you should be able to run these scripts and 
  analyze the example data. After running, check if output is created in 
  data folders: ...\Example_data\Example_TRUST_TRIR_001\PARREC\Data_analysis\ 
  or ...\Example_data\Example_TRUST_TRIR_001\PARREC\Data_analysis.

- Change the variables 'Main_dir', 'TRUST_file' and/or 'TRIR_file' to process
  your own data.
